# 🧠 CTF Wiki 
Welcome to the CTF Wiki, this repository serves as a knowledge base, personal reference, and collection of write-ups for challenges I've solved on various platforms. 

### 🎯 The main objective
👉 to clearly document the techniques, methodologies, and vulnerabilities encountered, in order to effectively progress in offensive security. 

### 📝 Project Objectives 
- Centralize my writeups in one place. 
- Document each step of a challenge (reconnaissance, analysis, exploitation, escalation). 
- Keep track of my progress and learning. 
- Provide a reusable foundation for future projects or training.
